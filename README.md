## Demo/Screenshots 📸

*(Screenshots or a demo video would go here.  Since none were provided, this section is omitted for now.)*


## Quick Start 🚀

DiaryVerse is a Spring Boot application.  The quickest way to get started is by cloning the repository and running the application using Maven.


## Installation ⚙️

**Prerequisites:**

* Java 8 or higher installed and configured.
* Maven installed and configured.
* MongoDB database instance running.  (See Configuration section for details)

**Steps:**

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Netri-100224/DiaryVerse.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd DiaryVerse
   ```

3. **Build the application:**
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

4. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

**Troubleshooting:**

* **Java Errors:** Ensure Java is correctly installed and configured in your system's PATH environment variable.
* **Maven Errors:** Ensure Maven is correctly installed and configured. Check your internet connection as Maven downloads dependencies.
* **Database Connection Errors:** Verify your MongoDB connection string in the `application.properties` file (see Configuration section).


## Usage 📖

*(Detailed usage instructions with code examples would go here.  Due to limited code provided, this section is partially complete.)*

**Creating a Diary Entry:** *(Example using a hypothetical REST API endpoint)*

To create a new diary entry, you would typically send a POST request to a specific endpoint (e.g., `/api/entries`).  The exact format of the request would depend on the API design.  An example might look like this:

```json
{
  "title": "My Day",
  "entryText": "Today was a great day..."
}
```


## API Documentation 📚

DiaryVerse uses Springdoc OpenAPI for API documentation.  After running the application, you can access the interactive API documentation at `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html` (or a similar URL depending on your application's port).


## Configuration ⚙️

The application is configured using an `application.properties` file (located in `src/main/resources`).  Key configuration parameters include:

* **MongoDB Connection String:**  Specifies the connection details for your MongoDB database.  Example: `spring.data.mongodb.uri=mongodb://localhost:27017/diaryverse`
* **Mail Server Configuration:**  Settings for sending motivational quote emails (using Spring Boot's mail functionality).  This will likely include host, port, username, and password.
* **External API Keys:**  Keys for integrating with external APIs like ZenQuotes (for motivational quotes), WeatherStack (for weather data, if used), and Mailtrap (for testing email functionality).
